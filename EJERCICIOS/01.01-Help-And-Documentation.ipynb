    "In writing Python code for data science, I generally go between three modes of working: I use the IPython shell for trying out short sequences of commands, the Jupyter Notebook for longer interactive analysis and for sharing content with others, and interactive development environments (IDEs) like Emacs or VSCode for creating reusable Python packages. This chapter focuses on the first two modes: the IPython shell and the Jupyter Notebook. Use of an IDE for software development is an important third tool in the data scientist's repertoire, but we will not directly address that here. "

Start by launching the IPython interpreter by typing <span style=\"background-color:#d3d3d3\"> **ipython** </span> on the command line; alternatively, if you've installed a distribution like Anaconda or EPD, there may be a launcher specific to your system (we'll discuss this more fully in [Help and Documentation in IPython](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/d66231454ef753818dc9213c9b5942e067266966/notebooks/01.01-Help-And-Documentation.ipynb)).\n",

    "The Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based graphical interface to the IPython shell, and builds on it a rich set of dynamic display capabilities. As well as executing Python/IPython statements, notebooks allow the user to include formatted text, static and dynamic visualizations, mathematical equations, JavaScript widgets, and much more. Furthermore, these documents can be saved in a way that lets other people open them and execute the code on their own systems. Though you'll view and edit Jupyter notebooks through your web browser window, they must connect to a running Python process in order to execute code. You can start this process (known as a \"kernel\") by running the following command in your system shell: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ jupyter lab \n",
    "\n",
    "This command will launch a local web server that will be visible to your browser. It immediately spits out a log showing what it is doing; that log will look something like this: \n",

In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing list threads, and Stack Overflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) about topics you've found yourself searching on before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means. \n",

    "The Python language and its data science ecosystem are built with the user in mind, and one big part of that is access to documentation. Every Python object contains a reference to a string, known as a docstring, which in most cases will contain a concise summary of the object and how to use it. Python has a built-in help function that can access this information and prints the results. For example, to see the documentation of the built-in len function, you can do the following:\r\n",

    "### Tab completion of object contents \n",
    "\n",
    "Every Python object has various attributes and methods associated with it. Like the help function mentioned earlier, Python has a built-in dir function that returns a list of these, but the tab-completion interface is much easier to use in practice. To see a list of all available attributes of an object, you can type the name of the object followed by a period (\".\") character and the Tab key: \n",
    "\n",
    "In [10]: L.<TAB> \n",
    "        append() count    insert   reverse \n",

    "        copy     index    remove \n",
    "        \n",
    "To narrow down the list, you can type the first character or several characters of the name, and the Tab key will find the matching attributes and methods: \n",
    "\n",

    "        clear() count() \n",
    "        copy() In [10]: L.co<TAB> copy()  count() \n",
    "        \n",
    "If there is only a single option, pressing the Tab key will complete the line for you. For example, the following will instantly be replaced with L.count: In [10]: L.cou<TAB> \n",
    "\n",
    "Though Python has no strictly enforced distinction between public/external attributes and private/internal attributes, by convention a preceding underscore is used to denote the latter. For clarity, these private methods and special methods are omitted from the list by default, but it's possible to list them by explicitly typing the underscore: \n",

    "### Beyond tab completion: Wildcard matching \n",
    "\n",
    "Tab completion is useful if you know the first few characters of the name of the object or attribute you're looking for, but is little help if you'd like to match characters in the middle or at the end of the name. For this use case, IPython and Jupyter provide a means of wildcard matching for names using the * character. \n",

    "    PendingDeprecationWarning     Warning \n",
    "    ResourceWarning \n",

    "Notice that the * character matches any string, including the empty string. \n",
