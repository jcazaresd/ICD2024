    "In my mind, these critiques miss something important. Data science, despite its hype-laden veneer, is perhaps the best label we have for the cross-disciplinary set of skills that are becoming increasingly important in many applications across industry and academia. This cross-disciplinary piece is key: in my mind, the best existing definition of data science is illustrated by Drew Conway's Data Science Venn Diagram, first published on his blog in September 2010 (see the following figure)."

    "In my teaching both at the University of Washington and at various tech-focused conferences and meetups, one of the most common questions I have heard is this: “How should I learn Python?” The people asking are generally technically minded students, developers, or researchers, often with an already strong background in writ‐ ing code and using computational and numerical tools. Most of these folks don’t want to learn Python per se, but want to learn the language with the aim of using it as a tool for data-intensive and computational science. While a large patchwork of videos, blog posts, and tutorials for this audience is available online, I’ve long been frustrated by the lack of a single good answer to this question; that is what inspired this book."

    "Python has emerged over the past couple of decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets. This may have come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind. The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: NumPy for manipulation of homogeneous array- based data, Pandas for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, SciPy for common scientific computing tasks, Matplotlib for publication-quality visualizations, IPython for interactive execution and sharing of code, Scikit-Learn for machine learn‐ ing, and many more tools that will be mentioned in the following pages."

With this in mind, I make every attempt throughout this book to provide references to other interesting efforts, projects, and packages that are pushing the boundaries of what can be done in Python. Nevertheless, the packages I concentrate on are currently fundamental to much of the work being done in the Python data science space, and I expect they will remain important even as the ecosystem continues growing around them."
